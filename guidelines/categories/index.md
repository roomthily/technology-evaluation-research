**Analysability**

> The capability of the software product to be diagnosed for deficiencies or causes of failures in the
software, or for the parts to be modified to be identified.

**Changeability**

> The capability of the software product to enable a specified modification to be implemented.

**Installability**

> The capability of the software product to be installed in a specified environment.

**Interoperability**

> The capability of the software product to interact with one or more specified systems.

**Learnability**

> The capability of the software product to enable the user to learn its application.

**Maintainability**

> The capability of the software product to be modified. Modifications may include corrections,
improvements or adaptation of the software to changes in environment, and in requirements and
functional specifications.

**Portability**

> The capability of the software product to be transferred from one environment to another.

**Testability**

> The capability of the software product to enable modified software to be validated.

**Understandability**

> The capability of the software product to enable the user to understand whether the software is
suitable, and how it can be used for particular tasks and conditions of use.

**Usability**

> The capability of the software product to be understood, learned, used and attractive to the user, when used under specified conditions.

Other ISO categories that may be relevant in the criteria provided to date or to consider for future additions.

**Adaptability**

> The capability of the software product to be adapted for different specified environments without applying actions or means other than those provided for this purpose for the software considered.

**Attractiveness**

> The capability of the software product to be attractive to the user.

**Co-existence**

> The capability of the software product to co-exist with other independent software in a common environment sharing common resources.

**Efficiency**

> The capability of the software product to provide appropriate performance, relative to the amount of esources used, under stated conditions. [See additional efficiency definitions, time behavior, etc.]

**Operability**

> The capability of the software product to enable the user to operate and control it.

**Reliability**

> The capability of the software product to maintain a specified level of performance when used under specified conditions.

**Replaceability**

> The capability of the software product to be used in place of another specified software product for the same purpose in the same environment.

**Security**
