  <p>A set of resources and working products related to technology evaluation efforts
through ESIP and BESSIG communities. </p>

  <p>Any working documents are considered preliminary and subject to change.</p>

  <p>A goal is to create a suite of criteria and guidelines to evaluate research software products that is modular, current and actionable. </p>

  <h1 class="page-heading">Using this site</h1>
  <p>(Specifically, contributing to this site via Github.)</p>
  <p>The site was created with Jekyll 3 and hosted as a Github Pages site. You'll want to set up Jekyll with the Github Pages dependencies to "test" locally and ping me about being a contributor. See the <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/">Github</a> documentation for details. Contributions are welcome as forks, as issues, as annotation via hypothes.is or as comments provided through email or Slack or carrier pigeons. </p>
  <p>Beyond the Github options, the TRL subcategory pages (see <a href="{{ "/trl_evaluation/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">ESIP Testbed TRL Spreadsheet</a>) and RRL topic pages (see <a href="{{ "/rrl_evaluation/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">NASA RRL criteria</a>) include the hypothes.is annotation tools if you prefer adding comments that way.</p>
