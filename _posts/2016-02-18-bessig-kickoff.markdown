We have a few options, depending on the crowd. 

1. We can go through the groups and subgroups and consider what might be missing or what might be superfluous now. (Questions 1 & 2)
2. We can discuss very basically good code practices as they relate to a software artifact. Remember, we are evaluating the artifact more than the code itself.
3. We can pick another question of the list (or add to it) to discuss.
4. {Some other topic by quick consensus **but** that is not tied to management because we can't evaluate that here.}
